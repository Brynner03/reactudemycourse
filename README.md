# React Course
 In this course, I will be refreshing my mind and learning new things about React.
 ## More than just React
 After going skimming through the course lectures, I noticed that I will be earning more about React Hooks, Redux , Router. Yes, I did learn this in my GA bootcamp, but I would love to learn even more as I really enjoy React. I will also learn some Next.js, and I am extremely excited about that! I will be sharing the projects that I've built throughout this course, and if I'm stuck, I will use my resources to my advantage. Wish me luck!
